manage animal number

If the population of a wild animal has been reduced to less than 10,000, and after being protected, the natural recovery is slow, all should be classified as conservation animals to be protected, restricting or prohibiting catching and trading.
If the population is less than 1,000, it is on the verge of extinction!
